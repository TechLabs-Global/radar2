The time of sharing files with a version inside its name is over â€“ no more Project_v1.txt, Project_v2.txt, Project_v3.txt!

In this session we want to prepare you for the project phase and show you how to work efficiently in a team. We will introduce you to GitHub, a platform for version control and collaboration. We will show you how to create a repository, how to work with branches, and how to merge your changes into the main branch.

In addition to GitHub we also want to use this event as a "Setup-Workshop" for the project phase. We will help you to set up your development environment and be there to answer all your questions.

The event will be held online as it is way easier to share screens"""

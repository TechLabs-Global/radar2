One of the most important aspects of the Digital Shaper Program is the community. So we want to give you a platform to connect.

This is why this event is all about getting to know each other in a 'Meet&Eat' manner. You will have several chats with other participants, talking about different topics e.g. hobbies and personal interests.
We are looking forward to you getting to know each other a little bit more and having a fun time together."""
